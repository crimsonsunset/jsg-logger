# JSG Logger - Session Summary

## 📋 How to Update This Doc

**This is a working document that gets refreshed each session:**
1. **Wipe accomplished items** - Remove completed tasks and achievements
2. **Keep undone items** - Leave incomplete tasks for tracking purposes
3. **Add new priorities** - Include new tasks and blockers that emerge
4. **Update current state** - Reflect what's working vs what needs attention

**Key difference from roadmap.md:**
- **This file:** Working session notes, gets refreshed as tasks complete
- **Roadmap.md:** Permanent historical record, accumulates progress over time

- **Documentation structure complete** - All standard files added
- **NPM package stable** - Version 1.0.6 published and working

### **Optional Future Enhancements** (Low Priority)
- [ ] **DevTools Panel** - Browser-based log filtering interface
  - Runtime-injected widget with Preact
  - Collapsible sidebar from left side
  - Controls console filtering without displaying logs
  - IndexedDB persistence for panel state
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring** - Track logging overhead metrics
- [ ] **Export Utilities** - Save logs to file formats
- [ ] **Framework Integration Guides** - React, Vue, Svelte examples

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### **NPM Publishing Lessons Learned**
- **Scoped Packages** - Need `--access public` for free publishing
- **Internal Imports** - Required multiple patch versions (1.0.1-1.0.4) to fix relative paths
- **Automated Scripts** - `npm run release` handles version bump + publish in one command

### **Architecture Highlights**  
- **Browser Logger Breakthrough** - Bypassing Pino for 100% console control
- **Hierarchical Config** - File > Component > Global precedence
- **Environment Detection** - Feature detection over user agent parsing
- **Runtime API** - Complete `logger.controls` interface for dynamic changes

### **Integration Success**
- **Vite Alias Removal** - Cleanly replaced `@logger` alias with NPM import
- **Build Compatibility** - Extension builds successfully with published package
- **Zero Disruption** - Existing DeskThing functionality unchanged

## 🎯 Next Session Possibilities

### **If Continuing Development** (Optional)
1. **DevTools Panel** - Browser interface for log filtering
   - Use existing `logger.controls` API (no custom filter engine needed)
   - Preact for minimal bundle size
   - IndexedDB for persistence
   - Runtime injection pattern

2. **Community Features** (If demand exists)
   - Framework integration examples
   - Performance monitoring dashboard
   - Export/import configuration utilities

### **If Project Maintenance Mode**
- **Monitor NPM usage** - See if package gains adoption
- **Address issues** - Respond to bug reports or feature requests
- **Version updates** - Maintain dependencies and compatibility
